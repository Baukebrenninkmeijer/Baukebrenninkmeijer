### Hi there, I'm Bauke ğŸ‘‹

I'm a deep learning practitionerğŸ§ /data scientistğŸ“ˆ at ABN AMRO, a Dutch bank. I have a background in computer science and data science. I have created some bots, worked on some deep learning implementations and some libraries related to synthetic data. 


- ğŸ”­ I'm currently trying to get back into the latest developments in computer vision and NLP, with stable diffusion and PaLM. 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about PyTorch and SOTA NLP or Computer Vision models! ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥
- ğŸ˜Š My favorite machine learning sources are [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co), [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) and [paperswithcode](https://paperswithcode.com)
